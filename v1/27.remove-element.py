#
# Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in place and
# return the new length.
# 
# 
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with
# constant memory.
# 
# The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond
# the new length.
# 
# 
# Example:
# Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
# 
# 
# Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums
# being 2.
